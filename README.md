<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Teaching is one of my hobbies, I'm teaching a lot of students, who have never learned to program. When I start learning my first programming language, I've got a problem, maybe you got these too. At first, I don't have an interesting task for practice. Second, your work doesn't review any programmer who has a lot of experience, of course, if u don't have a university with good teachers. That's why I develop this application.
